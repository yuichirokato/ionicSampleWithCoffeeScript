CoffeeScript Ionic Starter
===

Starting point for developing Ionic apps with coffeescript.



Getting Started
---

Enjoy coffeescript + sass w/ live reloading.

```
npm install
gulp watch
ionic serve
```
Coffeescript files in www/coffee will be compiled to JS and concated into www/js/application.js.  Sass files in www/sass will be compiled to CSS and concated into www/css/style.css.

Changes to any files in the project directory will trigger a reload in your browser, complete with your newly concated+compiled sass+coffee files!
